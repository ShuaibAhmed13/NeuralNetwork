# Neural Network from Scratch in Java
This neural network was fully created using only Java (no external libraries used).

This network can currently be trained to perform XOR operations with a 100% accuracy. It only has an ~87% accuracy rate at identifying the handwritten numbers from the MNIST database. I plan to further increase this accuracy by using convolution and pooling layers to maintain spatial information as well as lessen the input size.
