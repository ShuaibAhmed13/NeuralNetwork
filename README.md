# Neural Network from Scratch in Java
This neural network was fully created using only Java (no external libraries used).

This network can currently be trained to perform XOR operations with 100% accuracy. It only has a ~50% accuracy rate at identifying the handwritten numbers from the MNIST database. I plan to further increase this accuracy by involving Convolutional Neural Network concepts (such as creating a feature map) to make this network significantly better at image classification.
